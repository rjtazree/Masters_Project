Disaster
(khao suey) I didn't like it at all :))..... maybe it wasn't for me üòî.all I can say that it's not worth trying it ü•≤üëç
"(wonton noodles sop)personality I liked it.the flavor is there. I think it's quite healthy too. maybe a nice choice for patients.
I'm gonna check other menu too....so welcome ‚òùüèªüòå"
it was OK. average
cancelled one of my order üòí
Very sad that they dont pay attention to customers need.
Unusual taste.Not the taste we are familiar with.The taste was bad and price was high by judging the taste.On top of that they served the chicken with a sweet nut paste which was equally disgusting.
Worst experience... Ordered a larb gai salad... was delivered in ceapest takeaway packaging in a red shopping bag with no branding... Liquids were all spilt over... Found body hair on the package too
I'm not a critique though I liked it
Disappointed.
"Sooo goood! if you have a refined taste for food you will deffinetly appreciate food from this restaurant. its not your typical local asian restaurant, the owners must be well travelled"
"Ver bad , I ordered one tomyum n two sui momo but they gav me two tomyum soup n four soya sauce in a packet"
This is the 2nd time food was sent with it spilling out. Not sure why they don‚Äôt package it properly!!
satay was not good.raw cooked
don't order wonton with chilli oil.
Someone please tell them that Nasi Goreng must have egg included with it
My favourite from their menu is the steamed wonton with chilli oil. Try this if you haven't yet.
"their food quality has seriously degraded, some of the worst food I have had till date"
The springroll is not the same as before. Food came very late
Bad
Ordered mango sticky rice. It was disgusting
